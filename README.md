# Welcome to Open-Kun!
This repo contains Al-Bayan (Instant answer) that we use to serve the APIs on [alkun.org](https://alkun.org/).

All scripts in this repo are standalone and not tied to our engine (Al-Kun Alpha). Feel free to use it on your projects and also don't forget to contribute to this repo.

## The Stack
Our technology stack is simple. We believe in KISS and boring techs.
1. Javascript: We use javascript for most of the Bayan Answers.
2. WebAssembly: To speed up some answers.
3. Rust: if the answers are very complex and need further optimization.

You can set up the environment using the following steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alkun-org/open-kun
$ cd open-kun
```
