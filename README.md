# Welcome to Open-Kun!
This repo contains Al-Bayan (Instant answer) that we use to serve the APIs on [alkun.org](https://alkun.org/).

All scripts in this repo are standalone and not tied to our engine. We use Javascript for simple scripts and WebAssembly to speedup some heavy scripts. Feel free to use it on your projects.

## The Stack
Our technology stack is simple. We believe in KISS and boring techs.
1. Rust: We use Rust for most of the back-end.
3. HTML, vanilla JS: for our Website.
4. ArangoDB: for our data.
5. Redis: for caching, currently we use Dragonfly (Redis server alternative).

## Setting up
You can set up the environment using the following steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/akmalxxx/open-kun
$ cd open-kun
```
